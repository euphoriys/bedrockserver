## ⚡ Getting Started

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To set up your Minecraft Bedrock Server, begin by downloading [Termux](https://f-droid.org/repo/com.termux_1000.apk). Once installed, launch Termux and allow it to complete the initial setup process. When ready, enter the following command and wait for it to complete. After that, enter this command below to set up your environment.
> ```bash
> bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/euphoriys/bedrux/main/setup.sh)
> ```

### Starting your server
You can start the server with **`./start.sh`** or start it with **`./autostart.sh`** in the downloaded instance directory.

## 💡 Important Notes

### ARM64 Compatibility
The Minecraft Bedrock Dedicated Server is not originally designed for ARM64 architecture, which is common in most Android phones. To make this work, we utilize [Box64](https://github.com/ptitSeb/box64) to translate the server from AMD64 to ARM64.

> [!WARNING]
> Although this translation works, be aware that the performance may be reduced, and some issues may arise. The server’s performance will vary heavily depending on your device’s specifications.
